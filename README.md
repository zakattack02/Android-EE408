- **Icons**: Material Icons Extended for UI controls

### Key Components
- **MainActivity**: Main entry point with edge-to-edge display support
- **SimpleGOL**: Core game logic class implementing Conway's rules
- **SimpleGameOfLifeScreen**: Primary composable managing game state and UI
- **LazyVerticalGrid**: Efficient grid rendering for cellular automaton
- **Coroutines**: Smooth animation timing with `LaunchedEffect` and `delay`
- **State Management**: Reactive UI updates with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`


##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: Latest stable version (Hedgehog 2023.1.1+)
- **JDK**: Java 11 or higher
- **Android SDK**: API 24+ installed
- **Kotlin**: 2.0.21 (managed by project)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zakattack02/Android-EE408.git
   cd Android-EE408
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an existing Android Studio project"
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete

3. **Build and Run**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click the "Run" button or press `Shift + F10`
   - The app will install and launch automatically

## ðŸ“± Usage Instructions

1. **Launch the App**: Open Conway's Game of Life on your device/emulator
2. **Create Patterns**: Tap individual cells on the grid to toggle them alive (black) or dead (white)
3. **Start Simulation**: Press "Play" to begin automatic evolution of your cellular pattern
4. **Control Playback**: Use "Pause" to stop, "Step" to advance one generation manually
5. **Modify Board**: 
   - Adjust grid size with "- Width/+ Width" and "- Height/+ Height" buttons
   - Use "Clear" to reset the board or "Random" to generate a random pattern
6. **Speed Control**: Use the slider to adjust simulation speed from slow to fast
7. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the generation counter to track simulation evolution

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Quality Assurance

### Game Rules Implementation
Conway's Game of Life follows these simple rules:
1. **Birth**: Dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
2. **Survival**: Live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive  
3. **Death**: Live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors dies
4. **Toroidal Grid**: Edges wrap around (topâ†”bottom, leftâ†”right)

### Testing Strategy
- **Game Logic Tests**: Cellular automaton rule validation
- **UI Interaction Tests**: Grid cell toggling and control functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Large grid rendering and animation smoothness
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-device compatibility and user experience validation

##  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Large grids (25x30+) may slow down on older devices
   - Reduce grid size or simulation speed for better performance
   - Close other apps to free up memory during intensive simulations

2. **Grid Display Problems**
   - Ensure device has sufficient screen space for grid rendering
   - Rotate device to landscape for better visibility on smaller screens
   - Adjust grid size if cells appear too small to interact with
