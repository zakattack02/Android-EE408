## Documentation

- [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs)
- [Kotlin Language Reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)
- [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Gradle Build Issues**
   - Clean and rebuild the project: `Build > Clean Project` then `Build > Rebuild Project`
   - Check for correct Gradle and SDK versions

2. **Emulator Issues**
   - Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS
   - Allocate sufficient RAM to the emulator
   - Use x86 images for better performance

3. **Device Connection Issues**
   - Enable USB debugging on the device
   - Install proper USB drivers
   - Check ADB connection: `adb devices`
